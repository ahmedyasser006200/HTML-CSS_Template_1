# HTML-CSS_Template_1
HTML-CSS Design Number 1

This is a **practice project** I built while learning HTML and CSS from the amazing [Elzero Web School](https://www.youtube.com/@ElzeroWebSchool).  
The project is based on the **Template One** playlist, where I followed the instructor step-by-step and added my own touch as I progressed.

The original structure and design were part of the **"Template One"** playlist by [Osama Elzero](https://www.youtube.com/@ElzeroWebSchool).  
This project was built for **educational purposes**, and helped me strengthen my understanding of:

- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS basics and layout techniques
- Flexbox and responsive design
